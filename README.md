# NFT Collection

NFT Collection is a platform where users can own a Non-Fungible-Token and join CryptoDev community by paying 0.01 eth for the NFTs. We supplied 20 NFTs in total, so the first 20 people to mint would get the NFT.

The frontend of this project was built in NextJs while the smart contract was written in Solidity and deployed on Rinkeby testnet.
